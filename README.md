### Plugins Available

#### :: CypherArtist ::

This plugin generates the NFT(s) in-real-time, deriving the colour pallette using the payer's Cardano stake key (shared portion of the address, linking all addresses in a wallet). Each NFT minted for a given wallet is also unique from each other, including arrangement of some colour elements and some pattern elements and some of both. The CypherArtist generates the art, uploads/pins/hashes it for IPFS, and generates the resultant JSON files, returned to Minted for minting to finalize.
